Linear Search Approach: A simple approach is to do a linear search. The time complexity of the Linear search is O(n). Another approach to perform the same task is using Binary Search.  
Problem: Given an array arr[] of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in arr[].

Examples :  

Input : arr[] = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50, 
                     110, 100, 130, 170}
          x = 110;
Output : 6
Element x is present at index 6
