The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(Log n).
Problem: Given a sorted array arr[] of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in arr[].

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 50, 60, 80, 110, 130, 140, 170}, x = 110
Output: 6
Explanation: Element x is present at index 6
